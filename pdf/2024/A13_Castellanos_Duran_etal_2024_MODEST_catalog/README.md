**Abstract:** We present a catalog that contains depth-dependent information about the atmospheric conditions inside sunspot groups of all types. The catalog, which we named MODEST, is currently composed of 944 observations of 117 individual active regions with sunspots and covers all types of features observed in the solar photosphere. We used the SPINOR-2D code to perform spatially coupled inversions of the Stokes profiles observed by Hinode/SOT-SP at high spatial resolution. SPINOR-2D accounts for the unavoidable degradation of the spatial information due to the point spread function of the telescope. The sunspot sample focuses on complex sunspot groups, but simple sunspots are also part of the catalog for completeness. Sunspots were observed from 2006 to 2019, covering parts of solar cycles 23 and 24. The catalog is a living resource, as with time, more sunspot groups will be included.
