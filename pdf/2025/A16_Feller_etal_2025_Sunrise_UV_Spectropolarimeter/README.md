**Abstract**
The third science flight of the balloon-borne solar observatory SUNRISE carries three entirely new post-focus science instruments with spectropolarimetric capabilities, concurrently covering an extended spectral range from the near ultraviolet to the near infrared. Sampling a larger height range, from the low photosphere to the chromosphere, with the sub-arcsecond resolution provided by the 1-m SUNRISE telescope, is key in understanding critical small-scale phenomena which energetically couple different layers of the solar atmosphere. The SUNRISE UV Spectropolarimeter and Imager (SUSI) operates between 309 nm and 417 nm. A key feature of SUSI is its capability to record up to several hundred spectral lines simultaneously without the harmful effects of the Earth's atmosphere. The rich SUSI spectra can be exploited in terms of many-line inversions. Another important innovation of the instrument is the synchronized 2D context imaging which allows to numerically correct the spectrograph scans for residual optical aberrations. In this work we describe the main design aspects of SUSI, the instrument characterization and testing, and finally its operation, expected performance and data products.
