**Abstract:** Plages are small concentrations of strong, nearly vertical magnetic fields in the solar photosphere that expand with height. A high spatial and spectral resolution that can resolve their fine structure is required to characterize them, and spectropolarimetric capabilities are needed to infer their magnetic fields. We constrain the 3D fine structure of the magnetic field in the photosphere of a solar plage from a unique spectropolarimetric dataset with a very high spatial and spectral resolution and a fast temporal cadence. We analyzed spectropolarimetric observations of a solar plage in the two magnetically sensitive spectral lines of neutral iron around 630 nm. The observations were obtained with MiHI, which is an integral field unit attached to the Swedish Solar Telescope. MiHI obtained diffraction-limited, high-cadence observations with high spectral fidelity. These observations were interpreted using the spectropolarimetric inversion with magnetohydrostatic constraints, which allowed us to recover the magnetic and thermodynamic structure of the plage on a geometrical scale. The inversion results reveal that the magnetic field can reach up to 2 kG and that it expands significantly from the deep to the mid-photosphere. Weaker (≈200 G), and very small (subarcsecond) vertical magnetic loops lie beneath this canopy, rooted in the photosphere. This novel picture of a solar plage, in which weak opposite-polarity field patches surround the main polarity, provides new insight into convection in strongly magnetized plasma.
