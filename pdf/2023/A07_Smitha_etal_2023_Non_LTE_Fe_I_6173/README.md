**Abstract:** The current analysis is dedicated to a detailed investigation of the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects influencing the formation of the Fe I 6173 Å line, which is widely used by many instruments, including the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager on board the Solar Orbiter. We synthesize the Stokes profiles in a snapshot of a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the solar photosphere under both LTE and NLTE conditions. The simulation cube contains a sunspot and a plage region around it. The LTE and NLTE Stokes profiles formed in different features are compared and analysed. NLTE effects are evident in both intensity and polarization profiles. For the 6173 Å line, UV overionization is the dominant NLTE mechanism, and scattering effects are much less important. In addition to Fe, an NLTE treatment of Si, Mg, and Al is necessary to set the right photon density in the UV. This is found to further enhance the LTE departures compared to the case where Fe alone is treated in NLTE. These effects in the Stokes profiles survive even when the profiles are averaged spatially or sampled on a coarse wavelength grid such as that used by the SDO/HMI and other magnetographs. The deviations from the LTE profiles are stronger in the Fe I 6173 Å compared to the 6301 Å-6302 Å lines because in the latter case, line scattering compensates the effect of UV overionization. Based on the nature of departures from LTE, treating the 6173 Å line in LTE will likely result in an overestimation of temperature and an underestimation of the magnetic field strength.
